# SimpleEtherEscrow
* SimpleEtherEscrow is a solidity contract with a simple web interface that allows two parties (buyer and seller) to engage in trade. 
* An intermediary agent is used to remove any possibility of either party getting scammed.
* The contract runs on a simulated version of the Ethereum Network called Ganache, utilizing Web3.js (an Ethereum Javascript API) to connect to the blockchain.

* run Ganache
```Bash
$ ganache-cli <options>
```
